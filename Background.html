            <p>
                The Middle East is responsible for 27% of the global production of oil (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/biggest-oil-producers-middle-east.asp">1</a>). 
                Furthermore, the Middle East has 5 of the top 10 oil-producing countries. 
                This includes Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, Iran, and Kuwait.  
            </p>
           
            <h2>Saudi Arabia</h2>
            <p id="main-passage">
                Saudi Arabia has 12% of the global output of oil and is the largest petroleum exporter (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/biggest-oil-producers-middle-east.asp">1</a>). 
                Due to its high output and low costs, it is expected that Saudi Arabia will remain one of 
                the top oil producers in the future. Saudi Aramco is the group that controls the oil and gas 
                industry in Saudi Arabia and is a state-owned company. While no international oil companies 
                have any production in Saudi Arabia, Saudi Aramco has partnerships with Exxon Mobil, Royal 
                Dutch Shell PLC, Sumitomo Chemical Co., and Total S.A. through refineries and petrochemical 
                plants.

            <h1>Iraq</h1>
            <p>
                Iraq is next on our list, as it is the world's sixth-largest oil producer. It has seen a large 
                increase in production after the Iraq War (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/biggest-oil-producers-middle-east.asp">1</a>). However, it has a long way to go as it currently 
                is politically unstable, still has violence in the area, and doesn’t have sufficient infrastructure 
                to support further production. The Ministry of Oil in Baghdad is in control of the country’s oil 
                production which is run by many state-owned companies such as North Oil Company, the Midland Oil 
                Company, the South Oil Company, and the Missan Oil Company. In the Kurdistan region of Iraq, the 
                local Ministry of Natural Resources controls oil production. Many international oil companies are 
                involved with Iraq’s oil production. Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, and 
                Total S.A. are the major US and European oil companies that are tied to Iraq. The other countries 
                that are involved are China and Malaysia, so Iraq has some strong ties to some powerful countries.

            </a>

            <h1>UAE</h1>
            <p>
                The next largest oil producer in the Middle East is the UAE with an output of 4 million barrels per 
                day of oil (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/biggest-oil-producers-middle-east.asp">1</a>). It is the 7th largest oil producer in the world and is a federation of 7 emirates 
                with each emirate controlling the production of oil, but Abu Dhabi has the largest oil reserve. This 
                makes it the center for all the federation’s oil processes. The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company 
                (ADNOC) is the main group that controls oil production in Abu Dhabi and is state-owned. It, as well 
                as the other emirates, uses a similar deal with international oil companies. The same international 
                companies that have partnerships with Saudi Arabia have these production-sharing agreements with the 
                UAE.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                From these few examples we can see that many large oil producing countries can be located within the 
                region, and we can see that they have very similar structures to how oil is controlled. With this 
                project we hoped to find out more about how oil has effected these middle Eastern countries, 
                especially since we can see that they are tied to many international companies and large countries 
                like the US and China as well as countries in Europe. Furthermore, oil is a major source of wealth 
                that stimulates economies and provides civilizations to grow. From here we now move on to a few case 
                studies within the Middle East to get a better picture of how oil has changed these countries.
